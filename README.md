# Youtube-clone-Project
Youtube clone project(Html, css, js, MongoDB, NodeJs). This is a youtube website that I did as a project. I added a form page to upload thumb nail, title, description, and video to mongodb database. When the user click upload, the thumb nail with its details are uploaded on the homepage, and when click on the thumb nail, it takes the user to a page where the video is uploaded.
